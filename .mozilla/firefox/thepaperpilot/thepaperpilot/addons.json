Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license

Most common annoyance for YouTube videos is YouTube does not chose the best resolution for the currently playing video although there is another better video resolution already. Switching each video manually to a better resolution is awkward, difficult and time confusing. YouTube High Definition solves this common annoyance and loads all YouTube videos in Highest Definition automatically for you.\n\nBy default, YouTube High Definition plays the video in highest resolution automatically for you. But you can also specify YouTube High Definition to play all YouTube videos in a specific video resolution like 4K (2160p), 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p and 144p.\n\nYouTube High Definition not only loads the highest available resolution but plays the videos in Wide or Full Page style to better improve the High Definition experience. You can also choose the default YouTube videos player size, Shrink to play all YouTube videos in small mode. Also you can have all your YouTube videos in minimalist size by choosing Tiny video size option.\n\nAnother most common issue is the video annotations which can really expand and block YouTube videos and having them to turn off for each video is again difficult and time consuming. By YouTube High Definition, you can change the annotation settings for YouTube videos and can turn off annotations for all YouTube videos automatically by an easy single mouse click.\n\nYou can also change the video play behavior from YouTube High Definition settings. By default YouTube videos will start playing whenever the video player loads but you may want to auto stop YouTube all videos automatically and start playing and watching them whenever you want.\n\nHaving YouTube videos in sound is great but it can be disturbing especially in night mode. And some YouTube videos can change volume level time to time and adjusting volume to desired level again is unnecessary and annoying. YouTube High Definition can mute YouTube videos whenever the video player loads by default or have your YouTube videos specific volume level all the time.\n\nYouTube High Definition also improves listening music on YouTube by having all YouTube songs to have highest sound quality automatically for you.\n\nHaving all this settings are great for YouTube but there are millions of YouTube videos scattered around the web. You may also want to watch YouTube videos in High Definition on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. By adjusting YouTube High Definition settings you can also play all external (embedded) YouTube videos in High Definition, too and set the video playback behavior for all of them.\n\nYouTube High Definition also supports popular Flash add-on FlashBlock which is commonly used for YouTube so that FlashBlock users can also have high definition experience for YouTube videos.\n\nMultiprocess Firefox Electrolysis is being developed by Mozilla team and we have already support it beforehand so you can also have YouTube High Definition support for Firefox Electrolysis version.\n\nIf you may want to switch to Flash player to get more video quality options, you can use another add-on ( YouTube Flash Video Player ) from us.\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-flash-video-player/?src=userprofile\n\nIf you have any support questions, feature requests and bug reports, please do not hesitate to contact us by below support email address:\n\nsupport at barisderin dot com\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBaris Derin","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/104/104784.png?src=api&modified=1386577029","width":"256","height":"256","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/104/104784.png?src=api&modified=1386577029","thumbnailWidth":"150","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"homepageURL":"http://barisderin.com/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-high-definition/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":5,"reviewCount":222,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-high-definition/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":4745895,"weeklyDownloads":19216,"dailyUsers":270723,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/403587/youtube_high_definition-44.2-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":141848,"updateDate":1456311084000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"firefox-hotfix@mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/354/354399-32.png?modified=1452244815","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/354/354399-64.png?modified=1452244815"},"type":"extension","name":"Mozilla Firefox hotfix","version":"20160128.01","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":"This official add-on enables Firefox to provide quick fixes for selected issues.","fullDescription":"This official add-on enables Firefox to provide quick fixes for selected issues.
