# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. It used to have a command script and would attempt to install programs and set stuff up, but since then I've gone distro hopping and found the prospect of supporting all those overwhelming and not worthwhile.

So now it's really just config files. To create all the symbolic links, clone this repo and run `config.sh`
